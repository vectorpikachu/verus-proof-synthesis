1. Add loop invariants to the given Rust code, if there are loops in the code, so that Verus can verify the give function behaves exact what is described in the specifications
2. Add the proof blocks that could help Verus to prove the following code snippet. You need to analyze which locations in the code need to be proved and add the proof blocks to help Verus to prove the correctness of the code. You can insert multiple proof blocks in the code as long as they are necessary to prove the correctness of the code. You can also include new ghost variables that could help you to prove the correctness of the code.

Here are some principles that you have to follow:
Respond with the Rust code only, do not include any explanation.
If a function is marked with unimplemented!(), please leave it there and do NOT try to add new implementation.
You should never change or delete any existing code.
If this function contains no loop, feel free to leave it as it is without adding anything.

Please follow these steps in adding loop invariants for every loop:
1. You should identify every variable that is read in the loop  (e.g., x[k], y), particularly for array elements like x[k], and add an invariant about the initial value for EACH such variable and array;
2. You should identify every variable that is written (e.g., y = ..., x.set(..,..)) in every loop, and add an invariant about the value of that variable. Even if an invariant is already specified earlier in the program, please do repeat it in every loop suitable. Copy them in the response.
3. You should fully utilize the spec functions and proof functions in the invariant.

Here are some common locations where you can add proof blocks:
1. In the beginning of the function
2. Before the loop
3. In the beginning of the loop
4. In the end of the loop
5. Before the key operations
6. After the key operations

The proof block looks like this:
```
proof {
    // your proof code here

The ghost variable looks like this:

## Step 1: Add Loop Invariants
Your mission is to add loop invariants to the given Rust code, if there are loops in the code, so that Verus can verify the give function behaves exact what is described in the specifications.

Here are some principles that you have to follow:
Respond with Rust code only, do not include any explanation.

2. You should identify every variable that is written (e.g., y = ..., x.set(..,..)) in every loop, and add an invariant about the value of that variable. Even if an invariant is already specified earlier in the program, please do repeat it in every loop suitable.
3. You can leverage the spec functions and proof functions in the invariant.

## Step 2: Constant propagation refinement

If an upper bound or a lower bound about a constant function parameter (e.g., X < ..., X > ...) is provided in the function pre-condition (i.e., in the `requires' code block at the beginning of the function), 
please copy that (e.g., X < 10, X > 5) as a loop invariant to every loop in the function. 
Even if an invariant is already specified earlier in the program, please do repeat it in every loop suitable.

## Step 3: Array length refinement

For every loop in the function, please identify every array that is read (e.g., x[k]) or written (e.g., x.set(..,..)) in it, and then add a loop invariant that specifies the length of the array (i.e., x.len() == ...).

## Step 4: Quantifier range refinement

Please take the following steps to check every loop invariant that involves an array (e.g., x[k]) in the given Rust code:
If this array x[k] has been modified in this loop through x.set(), leave this invariant as it is, do NOT make any changes, and move on to the next invariant. 
Otherwise, when there is no x.set() in the loop, please make sure that the invariant covers every element in the array and hence has the form like `forall |k:int| 0<= k < x.len() ==> whatever-property'. When you make this change, please use a comment to explain why you believe the related array is never changed in the loop. Do NOT make any other changes to the code or the loop invariant!

## Step 5: Conditional loop invariant refinement

Your mission is to refine some loop invariants in the given Rust code only if the loop has special handling for the first iteration. This is what you should do: if an existing loop invariant P holds for all iterations of the loop except for the first iteration (e.g., some variable updates may only (not) occur during the first loop iteration), please leave P as it is and add another loop invariant conditioned on the loop index (e.g., index > 0 ==> P), following the example below. 
Do not change P or any other loop invariants in any other way."""

Here are some principles that you have to follow:
Response with the Rust code only, do not include any explanation.
You should only add assertions with non-linear property if necessary in the following ways, and you should not make any other changes to the program.

Nonlinear arithmetic involves equations that multiply, divide, or take the remainder of integer variables (e.g., x * (y * z) == (x * y) * z). Verus can reason about nonlinear arithmetic, but it needs to be told when to do so. To do this, you need to add a special keyword `nonlinear_arith' to the assert statement.
For example, if we know that variable X equals k*k+2*k and that variable Y equals (k+1)*(k+1), to prove that X+1 equals Y, we have to write the following statement to help Verus:

    assert(X+1 == Y) by (nonlinear_arith)
        requires
            X == k*k+2*k,
            Y == (k+1)*(k+1),
            0 < k,
            k < N,
            N <= 300,
            {}

In this example, the `nonlinear_arith' would enable Verus to use its non-linear reasoning to prove X+1 equals Y. The requires statements should include all the information that is needed to reason about the assert statement, including any variable bound information that is need to prove no-arithmetic overflow.

Please check the given program, and add nonlinear_arith assertion when Verus needs to reason about non-linear properties."""

Verus cannot prove that a non-linear expression does not overflow unless you tell it the range of the expression.
For example, if a non-linear expression x*x*x is used in the program, only tell Verus 0 <= x <= 10 is not enough, we have to write the following statement to help Verus prove no arithmetic overflow for x*x*x:

    assert(0 < x*x*x <= 10 * 10 * 10) by (nonlinear_arith)
        requires
            0 < x,
            x <= 10,
            {}

In this example, the `nonlinear_arith' keyword enables Verus to use its non-linear reasoning, and 
the `requires' statements should include all the variable bound information needed to prove no-arithmetic overflow.

Please check the given program, and add above nonlinear_arith assertions when needed. Note that both the lower bound and upper bound of the expression should be specified in the assertion.
